<h3>C:>OPEN DOSGAM.TXT</h3>

<p>I still consider PC games of the DOS/WIN95 era a much more influential a part of my childhood than console games of that time, such as those on Nintendo (even though I did spend a lot time playing games on the NES and SNES with friends).

 <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://samuelhewitt.com/blog/img/2015/dos-wheel-of-fortune.gif" alt="Wheek of Fortune"></p>

<p>This Wheel of Fortune game is one of my earliest computer game memories.</p>

<p>Mind you, my experience with DOS games was more so watching my older brother play (mostly FPS) games like Doom, Wolfenstein and Duke Nukem, all of which I was arguably too young to be watching but still influenced my later gaming preferences (and looky-here I did not commit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre#Video_games">school shooting</a>.</p>

<p>Even many many years later I still enjoy replaying old DOS games in my collection, simply for the nostaligia of it.</p>

<p>For instance, I am currently replaying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Dark_Forces">Star Wars Dark Forces</a> (which is still one of my favourite games) using <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>, more specifically through the <a href="http://boxerapp.com/">Boxer app</a> on the Mac.</p>

<p>This nostalgia and fond memories of games long past is why I think many people (like myself) still find themselves wanting to replay them and/or develop ways to do so and many games are still great in spite of their age.</p>
