Out of the blue, I got an email that I had redeemed an Xbox Live Gold gift card to an unused Microsoft account. I don’t have or ever have owned an Xbox, so I suspected something was up. So I thought about going through the usual thing of resetting and changing my password, but it’s a hassle.

## I’m Lazy

I’m willing to bet that you, just like me, are guilty of kinda being lazy and using the same password or same few passwords for all our online accounts over and over, like your dog’s birthday plus your favourite hot sauce with some puncuation in there: `05-05-2013.Sriracha`. This is not secure but dealing with passwords is hell.

Enter 1Password.

## 1Password

1Password is a password manager that can sync locally or via their cloud service (it doesn’t have a free tier like LastPass, but it’s better designed so I went with 1Password).

It does the job, their desktop apps are featureful and I use both the Mac and Windows apps (when I’m on those platforms), unfortunately there’s no Linux app but there are a browser extensions or a web UI if you opt to use their cloud service for syncing passwords.

Anyway, check it out. I recommend everyone use a password manager and I recommend 1Password.
