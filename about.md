<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>My name is Piyush Sonar and I'm a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong>, <strong>Data Engineer</strong> & <strong>AWS Cloud Associate</strong> living in Pune,India.</p>

<p>I am currently a member of the <a href="https://education.github.com/students/experts">Github Campus Expert Program</a> and also a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/cloud-ambassador-program/"> AWS Educate Cloud Ambassador</a>. I was formerly an Ubuntu member.</p>

<p>In my work I tend to focus on back-end developement, front-end user interface & some graphic design. I am also novice Data and Machine Learnig Engineer. I believe that good software/app should be simple, have easy to understand user interface whitch in turn recflects in good user experience. If an application is meaningful and well-crafted, it need not be frequently redesigned nor deviate from familiar metaphors.</p>

<h2>Free Software</h2>

<p>I am a proponent of the use of Linux & free software and a believer in the open source model of development. As such, my design toolkit is comprised primarily of free & open source software (FOSS), primarily <a href="https://inkscape.org">Visual Studio Code from Microsoft</a> text editor for writing code and <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape </a> & <a href="https://gimp.org">GIMP</a> for graphics designing and use open source  libraries like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> for my machine learning projects. I also use other FOSS tools for development.

<p>To do my part as a member of the FOSS community, I've been a design contributor to many free software projects over the years, such as the <a href="https://elementory.io">elementary</a>, <a href="https://gnome.org">GNOME</a>, <a href="https://www.solus-project.com">Solus</a> and <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> projects, along with many other small contributions.</p>

<h2>Gaming!</h2>

<p>Aside from design and software developement, I'm have a great passion for gaming and content creation and my gaming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkIt7sFMRB0nfVDlIlnP7EA">youtube channel</a> is where I document many great gameplays and other endeavours.</p>
